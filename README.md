# Diwali-sales-data-analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data, employing Python and its powerful librariesâ€”NumPy for mathematical computations, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and seaborn for advanced graphical representations. The dataset comprises 11,251 entries detailing customer purchases, including user ID, customer name, product ID, gender, age group, marital status, state, zone, occupation, product category, number of orders, and total amount spent. Initial data exploration included examining the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and cleaning steps like removing null values and unnecessary columns. Further analysis focused on demographic insights, such as gender and age group distributions, as well as geographical patterns in orders and sales amounts. The project also delved into the impact of marital status and occupation on purchasing behavior. Visualizations were extensively used to highlight trends and patterns, including the distribution of orders and sales across different states, occupations, and product categories. Key findings were illustrated through bar plots and count plots, offering a clear understanding of consumer behavior during the Diwali festival period. This analysis provides valuable insights for retailers looking to optimize their marketing strategies and product offerings for future festivals.
